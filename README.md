# Image Classification & Semantic Segmentation
I worked on optimizing a deep learning model for image classification and semantic segmentation using CNNs and Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs). 

- Optimizing a Classification Network:
  - Implemented input normalization, residual blocks, dropout, data augmentation, weight regularization, and early stopping to maximize classification accuracy on the SuperTux dataset.
  - Achieved high accuracy while keeping training time efficient (~10 GPU minutes).

- Extending to Semantic Segmentation:
  - Transformed the classification network into an FCN for pixel-wise prediction.
  - Designed the FCN with skip and residual connections, strided convolutions, and transposed convolutions to handle arbitrary input sizes.
  - Used Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and accuracy metrics to evaluate performance on an imbalanced dataset.

- Technical Skills Demonstrated:
  - Deep Learning: CNNs, FCNs, data augmentation, model tuning
  - PyTorch: Implemented custom architectures, trained models efficiently
  - Computer Vision: Image classification and segmentation
  - Optimization Techniques: Regularization, data balancing, hyperparameter tuning
